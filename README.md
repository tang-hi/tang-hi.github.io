### Add content

You can add content by creating a new markdown file in `src/content/posts`. The file need metadata in the frontmatter, like this:

```md
---
title: title
pubDate: 2021-08-01
categories: ['article']
description: 'description'
---
```

Or, you can use the following command in your terminal to create a new post:

```bash
pnpm new-post
```

## Updating the theme

You can update the theme by running by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm update-theme
```

## Customization

Typography is highly customizable. The config file is in [src/theme.config.ts](src/theme.config.ts)

### Social links

Typography has built-in support for adding links to your social media accounts to the site via the social option in the config file:

```ts
export const THEME_CONFIG: App.Locals['config'] = {
  socials: [
    {
      name: "github",
      href: "https://github.com/moeyua/astro-theme-typography"
    }
    ...
  ]
}
```

The name is the icon name in [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/),
which will be automatically generated as the icon.

### Navigation links

By default, the navigation are `Posts`, `Archive`, `Categories` and `About`. You can add more in the config file:

```ts
export const THEME_CONFIG: App.Locals['config'] = {
  navs: [
    {
      name: "Categories",
      href: "/categories"
    }
    ...
  ]
}
```

And then add the corresponding page in `src/pages`, see more in [Astro Pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-pages/)

### Dark mode

Typography supports dark mode. You can change it in the config file:

```ts
export const THEME_CONFIG: App.Locals['config'] = {
  themeStyle: 'dark' // 'light' | 'dark'
}
```


### Internationalization (i18n)

Typography provides built-in support for multilingual sites. By default, the language is `en-us`, you can change it in the config file:

```ts
export const THEME_CONFIG: App.Locals['config'] = {
  locale: "zh-cn"
}
```

For now, Typography supports below languages:

- `en-us`
- `zh-cn`
- `zh-tw`
- `ja-jp`

You can see all supported languages in [src/i18n.ts](src/i18n.ts), and add more if you need.
